Look at the cloudless day
You captured me smiling
A fantasy life, you say
Is our silver lining
This is your life, dreams can come true
But like your memories of me
They'll be bittersweet and blue
This is your life, dreams can come true
But like your memories of me
They'll be bittersweet and blue
Bittersweet and blue
Bittersweet and blue
Oh, oh
Bittersweet and blue
